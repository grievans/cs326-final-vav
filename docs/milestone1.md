# Data Interactions 
Users can choose between 2 portals: one for quarantining students and another for task helpers. Quarantining students can enter in their name, location, phone number or email, and what they are requesting. Task Helpers can see all requests and choose to contact specific students if they need further clarification. Task Helpers can also mark requests as in the process of being completed, and then the original requester can close the request once the task is complete.

Relevant data types would include names, addresses, contact details, task descriptions, categorization of types of request, responses/comments, and potentially images integrated into those comments and/or descriptions.
