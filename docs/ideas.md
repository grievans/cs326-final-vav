# Innovative Idea 
A site through which people quarantining could send out requests for errands such as food deliveries, then other users could respond to them to coordinate and ask for clarification before carrying out the tasks.

# Important Components 
Users can choose between 2 portals: one for quarantining students and another for task helpers. Quarantining students can enter in their name, location, phone number or email, and what they are requesting. Task Helpers can see all requests and choose to contact specific students if they need further clarification. Task Helpers can also mark requests as completed.
