# Innovative Idea 
A site through which people quarantining could send out requests for errands such as food deliveries, then other users could respond to them to coordinate and ask for clarification before carrying out the tasks. Most of the functionality doesn't totally directly relate to existing applications, though parallels between some aspects of it and existing services can be drawn&mdash;in terms of similar applications, it conceptually somewhat resembles a forum (with people making postings that others can reply to), though with a focus on specific requests rather than general discussions, as well as a job posting website (in that people make listings of requirements for others), but focusing on volunteering for one-time tasks rather than looking for long-term paid positions. Also in regards to existing applications, though not one it particularly resembles, note that integrating some connectivity with Google Maps would be useful for allowing one to quickly go from a request's address to the directions to that destination. 

# Important Components 
Users can choose between 2 portals: one for quarantining students and another for task helpers. Quarantining students can enter in their name, location, phone number or email, and what they are requesting. Task Helpers can see all requests and choose to contact specific students if they need further clarification. Task Helpers can also mark requests as in the process of being completed, and then the original requester can close the request once the task is complete.

Relevant data types would include names, addresses, contact details, task descriptions, categorization of types of request, responses/comments, and potentially images integrated into those comments and/or descriptions.
