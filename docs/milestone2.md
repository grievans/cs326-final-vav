# Milestone 2

## Part 0: Project API Planning

TODO figuring out request types:

login, logout? (might only need to be client-side?), creating/editing accounts, get account data (to use use as defaults for contact info, etc.)

create task, get data of a task, resolve (delete) tasks, edit task info, mark task in progress (a variant of editing info? maybe separate since different authentication is needed to do it), get list of open tasks

create comment, get list of comments for a task?, deleting comments (might just make part of deleting a task)?


## Part 2: Front-end Implementation

TODO insert screenshots+brief description

## Division of labor
